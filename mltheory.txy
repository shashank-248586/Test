series have only one column but DataFrame having multiple column.

loc used when we want to select row and column based on there lables,but 
iloc used when we want specific position in a  DataFrame.

In supervised learnings both feature and lables are present in datasets.we perform prediction on that perticular
datasets.But in unsupervised learnings there are only feature datasets are given we perform clustering or gruping 
according to datasets.

In statistics and machine learning the bias-variance tradeoff describe the relation ship between a model's 
complexity ,accuracy ,and its predictions and how well it can make prediction on test dataset.

precision is the true positive divide by true positive plus flase positive
recall is true positive divide by true positive plus flase negative

when a machine learning model memories the dataset then that called overfitting.
to reduce it we add some error.

Cross validation is a technique for evaluating ml models by training several ml model on subsets of the avilable
input data and evaluating them on the complimentary subsets of data.

the lables sets of Regression is continious and for performance we use r2 matrix.
but the lables of classification is discrite we mesures it problbility value and for proformance we use 
accuracy score matrix.

Ensembling learning is a machine learning technique that aggrigates two or more learners in order to produce better
prediction.it contain several model as a single model.

Gradient descent is a technique that find optimum point  or the changes to the model that move it along a slope
or Gradient in a graph toward the lowest possible error value.

batch gradient descent computes gradient using the whole training sample, it is slow and computestionaly expensive
and take much time but stochastic gradient descent computes gradient using a single training sample ,it is faster
than batch and less computestionaly expensive.

As we increse the number of feature in traning purpose then it take both space and time so we use less feature to
perform our model.

in cost funtion l1 regularization is the 1 norm mean sum of modulos of parameters
but l2 regularization contain 2 norm mean euclidian norm or sum of squares of parameterds
 
Confusion matrix is a performance evaluation tool in machine learning representing the accuracy of a classification
model.

k nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest ml algorithm based on supervised learnings.
knn assumes the similarity between the new data and avilable data that is most similar to the avilable categories
This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well category.

support vectore machine is a type of supervised learning algorithm used in machine learning to solve classification 
and Regression tasks.SVM are perticularly good at solving binary classification problems which require classifying the
elements of a datasets into two grops 

To Conclude, hard margin SVM aims to find a hyperplane that perfectly separates the data into two classes
without any misclassification, while soft margin SVM allows some misclassification by introducing slack variables.

How Decision Trees Work?
The process of creating a decision tree involves:

Selecting the Best Attribute: Using a metric like Gini impurity, entropy, or information gain, the best attribute to split the data is selected.
Splitting the Dataset: The dataset is split into subsets based on the selected attribute.
Repeating the Process: The process is repeated recursively for each subset, 
creating a new internal node or leaf node until a stopping criterion is met 
e.g., all instances in a node belong to the same class or a predefined depth is reached.


Advantages of Decision Trees

Simplicity and Interpretability: Decision trees are easy to understand and interpret. The visual representation closely mirrors human decision-making processes.
Versatility: Can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
No Need for Feature Scaling: Decision trees do not require normalization or scaling of the data.
Handles Non-linear Relationships: Capable of capturing non-linear relationships between features and target variables.
Disadvantages of Decision Trees

Overfitting: Decision trees can easily overfit the training data, especially if they are deep with many nodes.
Instability: Small variations in the data can result in a completely different tree being generated.
Bias towards Features with More Levels: Features with more levels can dominate the tree structure.

The random forest has complex data visualization and accurate predictions, but the decision tree has simple 
visualization and less accurate predictions. The advantages of Random Forest are that it prevents overfitting
 and is more accurate in predictions.

 Random Forest algorithm is a powerful tree learning technique in Machine Learning. It works by creating a number of Decision Trees during the training phase. Each tree is constructed using a random subset of the data set to measure a random subset of features in each partition. This randomness introduces variability among individual trees, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving overall prediction performance.

In prediction, the algorithm aggregates the results of all trees, either by voting (for classification tasks) 
or by averaging (for regression tasks) This collaborative decision-making process, supported by multiple trees 

with their insights, provides an example stable and precise results. Random forests are widely used for 
classification and regression functions, which are known for their ability to handle complex data, reduce 
overfitting, and provide reliable forecasts in different environments.

Features in machine learning, also known as variables or attributes, are individual measurable properties or 
characteristics of the phenomena being observed. They serve as the input to the model, and their quality and 
quantity can greatly influence the accuracy and efficiency of the model. There are three primary categories of 
features:

Numerical Features: These features represent quantitative data, expressed as numerical values (integers or 
decimals). Examples include temperature (°C), weight (kg), and age (years).
Categorical Features: These features represent qualitative data, signifying the category to which a data point 
belongs. Examples include hair color (blonde, brunette, black) and customer satisfaction (satisfied, neutral, 
dissatisfied).
Ordinal Features: These features are a subtype of categorical features, possessing an inherent order or 
ranking. Examples include movie ratings (1 star, 2 stars, etc.) and customer service experience (poor, average, 
excellent).

does not make many of the key assumptions of linear regression and general linear models that are based on ordinary least squares algorithms – particularly regarding linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, and measurement level.

logistic Regression First, logistic regression does not require a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.  Second, the error 
terms (residuals) do not need to be normally distributed.  Third, homoscedasticity is not required.  Finally, 
the dependent variable in logistic regression is not measured on an interval or ratio scale.

Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore, the outcome must be a 
categorical or discrete value.
It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it 
gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.
In Logistic regression, instead of fitting a regression line, we fit an “S” shaped logistic function, which
 predicts two maximum values (0 or 1).

sigmoid function is =1/(1+e^-x) 
used in classification model

cost function in logistic regression is -1[ y(log(y')) + (1-y)log(1-y')]

Logistic regression can be applied to solve multiclass problems. For each class, build a logistic regression to 
find the probability the observation belongs to that class. For each data point, predict the class with the 
highest probability. Normalizes probabilities so they sum to 1

The regression model which uses L1 regularization is called Lasso Regression and model which uses 
L2 is known as Ridge Regression.
l1 regression is 1norm but l2 regularization is 2norm

Regularization: XGBoost incorporates both L1 (Lasso regression) and L2 (Ridge regression) regularization 
techniques, which help prevent overfitting by penalizing complex models. This feature enables the algorithm to 
produce more generalizable models, making it suitable for a wide range of business applications.


As we know, Ensemble learning helps improve machine learning results by combining several models. This approach
 allows the production of better predictive performance compared to a single model. Basic idea is to learn a 
 set of classifiers (experts) and to allow them to vote. Bagging and Boosting are two types of Ensemble Learning. These two decrease the variance of a single estimate as they combine several estimates from different models. So the result may be a model with higher stability. Let’s understand these two terms in a glimpse.

Bagging: It is a homogeneous weak learners’ model that learns from each other independently in parallel and 
combines them for determining the model average.
Boosting: It is also a homogeneous weak learners’ model but works differently from Bagging. In this model, 
learners learn sequentially and adaptively to improve model predictions of a learning algorithm.

XGBoost supports missing values by default. In tree algorithms, branch directions for missing values are learned during training. Note that the gblinear booster 
treats missing values as zeros.

When the missing parameter is specified, values in the input predictor that is equal to missing will be treated 
as missing and removed. By default it’s set to NaN.

Flexibility: XGBoost is a flexible algorithm that can be used for a variety of machine-learning tasks, including classification, regression, and ranking. It is also compatible with a wide range of programming languages, including Python, R, and Java.

Disadvantages:

Complexity: XGBoost is a complex algorithm that requires some degree of technical expertise to implement and optimize effectively. It can be challenging to configure and tune the many hyperparameters that are involved, which can make it time-consuming to work with.

Overfitting: While XGBoost includes regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, it is still possible for the algorithm to overfit the training data. This can lead to inaccurate predictions of new data.

Memory usage: XGBoost can be memory-intensive, especially for large datasets. This can make it challenging to run on computers with limited memory, leading to slower performance.

Lack of transparency: XGBoost has often been considered a "black box" algorithm, which means that it can be difficult to interpret and understand how it arrives at its predictions. This can make it challenging to troubleshoot and fine-tune.
