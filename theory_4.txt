A measurement of central tendency is a summary measures that to attempts to describe a whole set of data with a sing
value that represens the middle or center of the data.
3 measures of central tendency are mean,median,mode.

A measures of dispersion is describe the data point how far from center or mid point.
Standard Deviation is the most commen used as dispersion.

21.
skewness is the measure of asymmetry of distribution.
skewness is two type (i)->right skewness ,(ii)->left skewness.

22.
The main difference between pdf and pmf is pmf is used for discrit random variable or function of discrit random
variable but pdf is used for continuous random variable function.

23.
correlation is a statstical measure that expresses the extend ti which two variables are linearly dependent.
there are two type of correlation are in statistics positive correlation and negative correlation.

25.
correlation define a statstical measurement that determines how two features are correlated but regression determines how one 
features dependent or represents a label.
in correlation only features are present but in regression both features and label are present.
in correlation only two features can be compared but in regression many features along with one label can compared.
correlation not predict any but regression also.

26.
price at agra = 70
correlation = +0.8
value at delhi = 70+0.8*70 = 126

27.
variance of x = 9
regression lines are 8x-10y=-66  40x-18y=214
mean value of x =13 mean value of y = 17
coefficent of correlation between x&y = 0.75

28.
Normal distribution also known as the Gaussian distribution is a probability distribution that symmetric about 
the mean.
the 4 assumption of normal distribution are
i-> symmetric
ii-> unimodal
iii-> asymptotic
iv-> mean,median and mode are equal.

29.
Normal distribution curve is symmetric about its mean.
its mean,median and mode are allign in one centerd.
68% data lies in one Deviation, 95% data lies in two deviation and 99.7% data lies in three deviation.
skewness is 0.

b,c,d are right.

mean  = 60
std = 10
i between 60-72 34% data 
ii between 50-60 34% data
iii beyond 72 16% data
iv 70-80 13.5% data

32. mean  =49
std =  6
2400 students scores more than 55
20 students score more than 70

33.
mean = 65
std = 5
no of students =500
80 students have height above 70 inchs
340 students vave height between 60-70inches

A statment about the nature f a population.it is often stated in terms of a population parameter.
there is an null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis.
There are two type error in hypothesis testing such as 
Type-1 when you say that null hypothesis is false when it actually is true.
Type-2 when you say that null hypothesis is true when it actually is false.

if the size of sample is greater than 30 then it is large sample if less than 30 then it small sample.
