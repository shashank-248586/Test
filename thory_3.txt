1.	Static variables have fixed memory locations,limited scope while dynamic variables are run time memory allocation,boarder scope and object-specified data.
2.	Pop() :- used for delete a specified value with key.
Popitem():- used for delete last key value pair of a  dictinary;
Clear():- used for remove all the key value paie in that dictionary.
Ex:-
Car = {
“uxv”:12,
“srt”:20,
“gtx”:24
}
Car.pop(“uxv”);
Car.popitem();
Car.clear();
3.	Frozenset() is a method in python  to create an  immutable set object from a itrable.
Ex:-animal = [“deer”,”lion”,”elephant”]
New_animal = frozenset(animal)

4. mutable object in python are can change in further next line.
Ex:- dictinary,list
but immutable object are cannot change in python.
Ex:- tupple
5. __init__ is to bound to class when object is instasiate then we need to give parameters.
class animal:
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name  = name
    def get_name(self):
        print(self.name)

cow  = animal("cow")
cow.get_name()

6.doc string used to give clarify of a function if we need.
Ex:-
def fun():
    '''
        this is the example of docstring.'''
print(fun.__doc__)

8.break used for vanish the loop in programming.
for i in range(10):
    if(i == 8)break

continue used for skip the itration in a loop
for i in range(10):
    if(i%2 == 0 )continue
 
pass used in function to pass that function

9.self is bound to class
Ex:-
class frute:
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name
 
10.global attribute in python is that the variables can accessable to outside class
private attribute dont give access to access that variables
protected attribute give access to child class to access the variables

11.group of classes in same python file is called module 
group of module  in same file called package

12.list is mutable but tupple is immutable.
 
13.List comphersion:- make a list with readable and in sort manner.
Ex   a  = [ i for i in range(1,11)]

dist comphersion :- make a dictinary with value are in list comphersion.
Ex  a ={
    "apple":[i for i in range(1,11)],
    "banana":[i for i in range(4,20)]
}
 
14.decorators:- in python decorators are allow programming to modify the behaviour of a class or function.
Ex:-
def dec1(fun):
    def inner():
        x = fun()
        return x*x
    return inner
@dec1
def num():
    return 10;

print(num())

15. in python memory are managed in two way Static and dynamic.
16.lambda is a small anonymous function.
Ex:- x = lambda a: a+10
print(x(5))

17.split() occures split a string into substring by given value
Ex:- a = "ramensh is a good student"
sub_string = a.split(" ")
print(sub_string)

join() join the sub_string or list of character in a single string
Ex 
a = ['r','a','m','e','s']
print("".join(a))

18.
itraters in python occures itrate one by one 
Ex
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
it = iter(a)
print(next(it))
print(next(it))
print(next(it))

itrable in python are those object which can be looped over with the help of a for loop.
Ex list,string,dictinary

generatore is generate a pericular manner in python
Ex
generatore= [num **2 for num in range(20)]
it = iter(generatore)
next(it)


19.
range() returntype is list but xrange() returntype is xrange
range consume more memory than xrange


20.
pillers of oops are inheritance,encapsulation , polymerphism ,abstaction.

21.
issubclass() give whether a class is chid class or not.
22.
inheritance is the property of oops in which child class inhherits all attribute,methods of parent class.
inheritance 5 type :-single inheritance,multilebel inheritance, multiple inheritance, hirachical,hybrid.

23.
encapsulation is the process of in which a attribute can encapsulate form outliers.
encapsulation is 3 type public, private, protected.

24.
polymerphism means many forms.
in polymerphism includes methodoverriding and methodoverloading.
1.2
Serial_no,Hundred$,Total_Marks,total_Marks,_Percentag are valid identifier.
